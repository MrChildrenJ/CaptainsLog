# Captain's Log - Technical Risks Assessment

## High Priority Risks

### 1. Audio Processing Performance
**Risk**: Large audio files (30+ minutes) may cause timeout or memory issues  
**Impact**: High - Core functionality affected  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement audio chunking (5-minute segments)
- Use streaming processing for large files
- Add background job queue with progress tracking
- Set max file size limit (50MB)

### 2. Whisper Model Loading Time
**Risk**: 1.5GB model takes 30-60 seconds to load initially  
**Impact**: Medium - Poor user experience on cold start  
**Mitigation**:
- Keep model loaded in memory
- Implement health checks and pre-warming
- Use model quantization (int8) to reduce size by 75%
- Consider using Whisper API initially, migrate to self-hosted later

### 3. Real-time Transcription Latency
**Risk**: Users expect near real-time feedback  
**Impact**: Medium - User satisfaction  
**Mitigation**:
- Show recording waveform immediately
- Display "Processing..." status
- Stream partial results if possible
- Cache frequently used phrases

## Medium Priority Risks

### 4. Search Accuracy
**Risk**: Semantic search may miss exact phrase matches  
**Impact**: Medium - Users can't find specific logs  
**Mitigation**:
- Hybrid search: combine semantic + keyword search
- Allow quotation marks for exact match
- Provide search filters (date, duration, shared)
- A/B test search algorithms

### 5. Storage Costs
**Risk**: Audio files consume significant storage  
**Impact**: Medium - Operational costs  
**Mitigation**:
- Compress audio (MP3 128kbps)
- Implement retention policies
- Archive old logs to cold storage
- Offer premium tier for unlimited storage

### 6. Concurrent User Scaling
**Risk**: Transcription service bottleneck  
**Impact**: Medium - System availability  
**Mitigation**:
- Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes
- GPU cluster for peak loads
- Rate limiting per user
- Priority queue for premium users

## Low Priority Risks

### 7. Android Audio Recording Compatibility
**Risk**: Different devices handle audio differently  
**Impact**: Low - Affects some users  
**Mitigation**:
- Use MediaRecorder API (most compatible)
- Test on top 10 Android devices
- Provide troubleshooting guide
- Fallback to lower quality if needed

### 8. Privacy/Security Concerns
**Risk**: Voice data is sensitive  
**Impact**: Low - But critical if occurs  
**Mitigation**:
- End-to-end encryption for audio
- GDPR compliance (data deletion)
- Local processing option for sensitive users
- Clear privacy policy

## Technology Unfamiliarity Areas

### 1. Kubernetes Orchestration
**Current Knowledge**: Limited  
**Required For**: Auto-scaling transcription service  
**Learning Resources**:
- Kubernetes official tutorials
- Practice with Minikube locally
- Consider managed K8s (EKS/GKE) initially

### 2. WebSocket Implementation
**Current Knowledge**: Basic  
**Required For**: Real-time notifications  
**Learning Resources**:
- Socket.io documentation
- Build simple chat app first
- Fallback to polling if needed

### 3. Elasticsearch Optimization
**Current Knowledge**: Basic queries only  
**Required For**: Complex search features  
**Learning Resources**:
- Elasticsearch guide
- Consider managed service (Elastic Cloud)
- Start with simple queries, iterate

### 4. GPU Programming
**Current Knowledge**: None  
**Required For**: Optimizing Whisper performance  
**Learning Resources**:
- PyTorch GPU tutorials
- CUDA basics
- Use cloud GPU instances initially

## Development Timeline Risks

### Week 1 Blockers
- Environment setup complexity
- Model download times
- Docker networking issues

### Week 2 Blockers
- Integration between services
- Authentication flow
- Database migrations

### Critical Path Items
1. Audio recording → Must work perfectly
2. File upload → Size/format validation
3. Transcription → Accuracy testing
4. Search → User satisfaction

## Fallback Plans

### If Whisper is too slow:
1. Use Google Speech-to-Text API initially
2. Implement Whisper as "premium" feature
3. Offer both options to users

### If search is inadequate:
1. Start with simple text search
2. Add filters and sorting
3. Implement semantic search later

### If real-time features fail:
1. Email notifications as backup
2. Pull-based refresh
3. "Check back later" pattern

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Repository methods
- Audio processing functions
- Search algorithms

### Integration Tests
- API endpoints
- Service communication
- Database transactions

### Performance Tests
- 50 concurrent transcriptions
- 1000 searches/second
- 1GB audio file processing

### User Acceptance Tests
- Record 5-minute log
- Search for specific phrase
- Share with friend
- Play on different device

## Monitoring Requirements

### Key Metrics
- Transcription queue length
- Average processing time/minute
- Search response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Storage usage growth rate
- Error rates by service

### Alerts
- Transcription queue > 100 items
- Processing time > 2x audio length  
- Search latency > 500ms
- Disk usage > 80%
- Any service down > 1 minute

## Cost Projections

### Infrastructure (Monthly)
- Servers (4x medium): $400
- GPU instance: $500
- Storage (1TB): $100
- CDN/Bandwidth: $200
- **Total**: ~$1200/month

### Per User Costs
- Storage: $0.10/user/month
- Transcription: $0.001/minute
- Bandwidth: $0.05/user/month
- **Break even**: ~10,000 active users

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

### After Week 1:
- ✅ Basic recording works
- ✅ File upload successful
- ✅ Whisper runs locally
- ❌ If not → Simplify scope

### After Week 2:
- ✅ End-to-end flow works
- ✅ Search returns results
- ✅ Friends system designed
- ❌ If not → Focus on core features only
